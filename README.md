# Beginner-Tic-Tac-Toe-Project
This is a Tic Tac Toe game I created as an introductory python project. It is played entirely in the built-in python console and is a great beginner project for any individual attempting to ameliorate their python knowledge through application. 
The project utilizes various beginner friendly concepts, expanding one's ability to make decisions and problem solve through code. 

**THIS CODE INCLUDES:**

• Variable declarations and assignments

• Arithmetic expressions

• Use of if/elif/else statements

• Use of types and their methods/operations (strings, lists, tuples etc)

• Use of a for loop (sequence iteration)

• Use of a while loop (general iteration driven by a condition)

• Use of user-defined function

• Print statements for displaying output

• User input

• Reading an input from a file and writing an output to a file

• Use of F-Strings

• Importing Modules

• etc

**TO RUN THE PROGRAM:**

Download the folder titled "Tic Tac Toe". Run the file, "Ali Zarabi - Console Tic Tac Toe.py" in any IDE of your choosing. Make sure the attatched text file, "History.txt", and the .py file are in the same location on your device as to ensure proper function.
