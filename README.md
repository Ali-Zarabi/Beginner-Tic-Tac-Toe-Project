# Beginner-Tic-Tac-Toe-Project
This is a Tic Tac Toe game I made for an introductory python course. It is played entirely in the console and is a great beginner project for anyone looking to build their python knowledge through application. 
The project utilizes various beginner friendly concepts, developing one's ability to problem solve and make decisions through code. 

**The code includes:**

• Variable declarations and assignments

• Arithmetic expressions

• Use of if/elif/else statements

• Use of types and their methods/operations (strings, lists, tuples etc)

• Use of a for loop (sequence iteration)

• Use of a while loop (general iteration driven by a condition)

• Use of user-defined function

• Print statements for displaying output

• User input

• Reading an input from a file and writing an output to a file

• Use of F-Strings

• Importing Modules

• etc
